# 👋 Hi, welcome to Å Energi @ GitHub!
Here at Å Energi we use GitHub to create some really cool stuff. But sadly we don't have that much to show right here on GitHub. But go to [developer.aenergi.no](https://developer.aenergi.no/) if you want to browse some more 😉

## 🔐 Want access?
If you are an Å Energi employee, or working for any of our subsidiaries like Glitre Nett, Å Entelios, Å Insite, and so on. You can apply for access to our GitHub community and all the sweet stuff 🍭

1. You need a GitHub account. You can either use a personal account, or create a new one just for your Å Energi tasks 🫡

2. Go to your profile's settings page and add your Å Energi (or subsidiary) email address under `Emails`. You will receive a verification email that needs to be confirmed.

3. Login at [myaccess.microsoft.com](https://myaccess.microsoft.com/@kraftsenter.onmicrosoft.com#/access-packages) and select the access package [`GitHub Enterprise`](https://myaccess.microsoft.com/@kraftsenter.onmicrosoft.com#/access-packages/599577f1-b114-4d65-ac07-87648990d646).

4. Grab a cup of ☕ and wait for the [DevEx](mailto:devex@aenergi.no) team to approve your request. We can be quite busy some times. If you are in a real hurry, don't send a 🕊️, contact us on Teams instead 🖖
